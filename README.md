ðŸŒŸ Week 1 Recap: Productivity and Learning in the DEPI Program - Egypt! ðŸŒŸ

Excited to share my journey in the first week of the  Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI), specializing in Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Assessment! The program is off to an amazing start, and Iâ€™ve already gained valuable insights and hands-on experience in cybersecurity. Hereâ€™s a quick rundown of what I tackled this week:

	1.	Cybersecurity Awareness Best Practices
Explored essential practices that enhance cybersecurity awareness across organizations, ensuring that every layer of the team understands the importance of digital hygiene.
	2.	Designing a Secure Network Architecture
Learned the fundamentals of creating a secure, resilient network framework to protect against potential threats and ensure safe data transmission.
	3.	System Hardening Standards: ISO/IEC 27001
Delved into security standards and guidelines, particularly the globally recognized ISO/IEC 27001, which plays a key role in protecting critical assets.
	4.	Techniques for Systems Hardening
Investigated advanced methods for reducing vulnerabilities in systems, ensuring theyâ€™re resilient against potential attacks.
	5.	Systems Hardening in Cybersecurity
Studied how these techniques apply directly to real-world cybersecurity to reinforce and protect critical systems and infrastructures.
	6.	Hands-on Labs in TryHackMe
	â€¢	Intro to Network Room: Learned about core networking concepts crucial for cybersecurity roles. https://tryhackme.com/r/room/introtonetworking
	â€¢	Intro to Security Architecture Room: Gained a foundational understanding of how to design and implement secure architectures. https://tryhackme.com/r/room/introtosecurityarchitecture

Itâ€™s been an intensive yet rewarding week, diving into both theoretical and practical cybersecurity foundations. Looking forward to building on this knowledge in the coming weeks!
